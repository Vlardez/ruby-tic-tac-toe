## Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe ##

This is an assignment/project in practicing Object-Oriented Programming practices. 
It should be playable from the command line after running the main script. 

The main ideas I'm practicing are consistent and clear coding style, DRY, intuitive organization, and efficient coding.
